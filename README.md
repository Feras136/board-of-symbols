how to start:

For Visual Studio users:
in order to run the compile and link command cl some environment variables have to be set. The program reads these variables from the file vc.properties. You can build a version for your system as follows:
- open a command window
- go to the Visual Studio directories and run vsvarsall.bat script 
- in the command window return to the jserver directory
- type: set > vc.properties 
- open this file in an editor and replace all \ with \\
